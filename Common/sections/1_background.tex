\section{Background}
Refractive errors pose a significant public health concern globally, particularly in low-income communities \parencite{world2019report}. 

\subsection*{Global Burden of Refractive Errors}
Refractive errors, encompassing \gls{myopia}, \gls{hyperopia}, \gls{astigmatism}, and \gls{presbyopia}, impose a substantial burden on public health worldwide, affecting individuals of all ages and demographics \parencite{morgan2012worldwide}. The prevalence of refractive errors varies across populations and geographical regions due to various factors such as genetic predisposition and the history of prescription eyewear \parencite{flitcroft2012global, sherwin2012environmental}.
